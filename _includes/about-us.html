				<h3>What is our purpose?</h3>
				<p class="text-faded">
					The Data Science and Analytics Club (DSAC) exists to promote student led exploration of data science
					topics and opportunities.
				</p>
				<h3>Why do we exist?</h3>
				<p class="text-faded">
					We believe that by organizing we can provide Data Science opportunities to the UVA student body that
					couldn't be provided otherwise. These opportunities come through the clubâ€™s shared effort, elevated
					status, and increased resources.
				</p>
				<h3>What do we offer?</h3>
				<p class="text-faded">
					DSAC endeavours to offer resources to the UVA student body: (1) a community of other students
					interested in DS regardless of their own major, (2) workshops teaching DS skills, (3) opportunities
					to learn about the DS community at large around UVA and (4) real, impactful projects to flex and
					demonstrate DS skills.
